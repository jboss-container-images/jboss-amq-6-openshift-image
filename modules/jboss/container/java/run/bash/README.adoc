== Environment Variables

The following environment variables are used to configure the functionality provided by this module:

|=======================================================================
|Name |Description |Example
|JAVA_APP_DIR |^ The directory where the application resides. All paths in your application are relative to this directory. |myapplication/
|JAVA_ARGS |Arguments passed to the `java` application. |
|JAVA_CLASSPATH |^ The classpath to use. If not given, the startup script checks for a file `**JAVA_APP_DIR/classpath**` and use its content literally as classpath. If this file doesn't exists all jars in the app dir are added (`classes:**JAVA_APP_DIR/***`). |
|JAVA_DATA_DIR |^ The location of the directory which should be used by the application for reading/writing application data.  Users should override the default if their application should use a different directory, e.g. if a persistent volume is used to persist data across restarts. |/var/cache/application
|JAVA_LIB_DIR |^ Directory holding the Java jar files as well an optional `classpath` file which holds the classpath. Either as a single line classpath (colon separated) or with jar files listed line-by-line. If not set **JAVA_LIB_DIR** is the same as **JAVA_APP_DIR**. |
|JAVA_MAIN_CLASS |^ A main class to use as argument for `java`. When this environment variable is given, all jar files in **JAVA_APP_DIR** are added to the classpath as well as **JAVA_LIB_DIR**. |com.example.MainClass
